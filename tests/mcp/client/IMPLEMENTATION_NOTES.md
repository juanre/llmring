# MCP Client Implementation Notes

## Summary

We successfully implemented a clean MCP client with the following features:

### 1. Clean Factory Design
- Removed all legacy code and backwards compatibility
- Implemented factory methods: `MCPClient.stdio()`, `MCPClient.http()`, `MCPClient.websocket()`
- Consolidated AsyncMCPClient into the main client.py file
- No technical debt or legacy patterns

### 2. Transport Implementation
- Fully functional STDIO transport that can:
  - Start subprocesses
  - Send JSON-RPC messages via stdin
  - Receive JSON-RPC responses via stdout
  - Handle notifications
  - Manage process lifecycle
  - Handle stderr for debugging

### 3. Protocol Compliance
- Correctly implements MCP protocol initialization sequence:
  1. Send "initialize" request
  2. Receive server capabilities
  3. Send "initialized" notification
  4. Proceed with other requests

### 4. Sync/Async Bridge
- Fixed coroutine reuse issues with proper asyncio handling
- Works correctly from both sync and async contexts
- Handles event loop edge cases properly

## Known Issues

### MCP Server Bug
The mcp-server (from ../mcp-server) has a bug where it doesn't properly maintain initialization state for stdio transport:

```
2025-05-25 17:19:09,426 - mcp_server.server.json_rpc_router - INFO - Client confirmed initialization
2025-05-25 17:19:09,527 - mcp_server.server.json_rpc_router - WARNING - Request before initialization: {'method': 'tools/list', 'has_session_id': False, 'session_id': None, 'has_context': True, 'context_initialized': None, 'global_initialized': False}
```

Even after receiving and acknowledging the "initialized" notification, the server still reports `'global_initialized': False` for subsequent requests.

This is NOT a client issue - our client correctly:
1. Sends the initialize request
2. Receives the response
3. Sends the initialized notification
4. The server acknowledges receiving it

## Test Status

- ✅ `test_sync_async_bridge.py` - All sync/async bridge tests pass
- ✅ `test_client_with_mock.py` - Client logic verified with mock transport
- ❌ `test_real_server_simple.py` - Fails due to mcp-server bug
- ✅ Transport layer tests - Direct transport communication works

## Usage Example

```python
# Sync usage
from mcp_client import MCPClient

with MCPClient.stdio(["python", "-m", "my_mcp_server"]) as client:
    client.initialize()
    tools = client.list_tools()
    result = client.call_tool("my_tool", {"arg": "value"})

# Async usage
from mcp_client import AsyncMCPClient

client = AsyncMCPClient.stdio(["python", "-m", "my_mcp_server"])
await client.initialize()
tools = await client.list_tools()
await client.close()
```

## Next Steps

1. Report the initialization state bug to the mcp-server maintainers
2. Consider implementing workarounds if needed (e.g., retry logic)
3. Add more transport implementations (HTTP, WebSocket)
4. Add comprehensive test coverage for error cases
