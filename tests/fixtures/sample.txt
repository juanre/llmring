This is a sample text file for testing file upload functionality.

It contains multiple paragraphs to simulate realistic text content.
The file is small enough to be easily processed but large enough
to verify that content is being correctly transmitted and received.

This is the second paragraph with some additional context.
We can use this file to test basic file upload operations
and ensure that the content arrives intact at the server.
