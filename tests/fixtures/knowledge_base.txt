Knowledge Base: Python Programming Best Practices

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its
clear syntax and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms
including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Best Practices:

1. Use meaningful variable names that describe the data they contain.
2. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for consistent code formatting.
3. Write docstrings for functions, classes, and modules.
4. Use type hints to improve code clarity and enable static analysis.
5. Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.

Testing:

Writing tests is crucial for maintaining code quality. Python's unittest
module provides a framework for writing and running tests. For more
advanced features, pytest is the preferred testing framework in the
Python community.

Virtual Environments:

Always use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies. Tools
like venv, virtualenv, or uv help manage project-specific packages
without affecting the system Python installation.
