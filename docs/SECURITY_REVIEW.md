Last updated: 2025-08-19

## Status: Issues Resolved

The security issues identified in the previous review have been addressed as part of the v3.3/v3.4 refactoring:

### Previously Identified Issues (Now Fixed)

1. **SSRF and unbounded download risk** ✅ FIXED
   - The safe_fetcher module now enforces strict controls
   - HTTPS-only, no redirects, size limits enforced
   - Content-type validation for images only

2. **Database logging of sensitive data** ✅ REMOVED
   - All database functionality has been removed
   - No logging of prompts, responses, or sensitive data to persistent storage
   - System is now stateless and local-first

3. **Missing timeouts and retries** ✅ IMPROVED
   - Provider calls now have appropriate timeouts
   - httpx clients configured with timeout settings

### Current Security Posture

The refactored LLMRing follows security best practices:

1. **No persistent storage**: No database means no risk of data leakage through logs
2. **API key protection**: Keys only stored in environment variables, never in lockfile
3. **Local-first design**: No backend communication unless explicitly configured
4. **Safe file handling**: URL fetching restricted and validated
5. **Minimal attack surface**: Removed complex database and caching layers

### Remaining Considerations

1. **API Key Management**: 
   - Users must secure their environment variables
   - Consider using secret management systems in production

2. **Lockfile Security**:
   - The lockfile contains model bindings but no secrets
   - Safe to commit to version control

3. **Receipt Signatures** (when server connected):
   - Ed25519 signatures provide authenticity
   - Private keys must be protected if self-hosting server

### Recommendations

1. Always use HTTPS when fetching remote content
2. Keep provider SDKs updated for security patches
3. Monitor provider API usage for anomalies
4. Use profiles to separate prod/dev configurations
5. Regularly validate lockfile against registry for drift detection
