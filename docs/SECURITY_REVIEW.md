### LLMRing: Security, Reliability, and Code Quality Review

Last updated: 2025-08-17

---

## Executive summary

LLMRing has a clean modular design and uses parameterized SQL, which is good. Key risks to address urgently:

- Critical: Remote-URL handling allows SSRF and unbounded downloads (OpenAI provider inlining and file utils).
- Missing explicit timeouts/retries/circuit breakers for provider SDK calls can cause hangs and fragile behavior.
- Potential leakage of sensitive data into database logs (system prompts, tool parameters, raw errors).
- Some blocking sync calls (Google SDK) without time limits; a few logging inconsistencies and import-time side effects.

Primary recommendations:

- Introduce a centralized, locked-down downloader and disable remote URLs by default.
- Enforce provider call timeouts, retries with backoff/jitter, and basic circuit breakers.
- Redact/truncate sensitive log fields; move DB logging off the hot path.
- Clean up import-time side effects, ensure consistent logging, and improve SQLite and Google-provider robustness.

## High-priority findings and recommendations

### 1) SSRF and unbounded download risk

Locations:

- `src/llmring/providers/openai_api.py`: inlines `image_url` content by fetching arbitrary `http(s)` URLs with `httpx.get(..., timeout=10.0)` and no size/content-type/host checks.
- `src/llmring/file_utils.py`: accepts any `http(s)` URL and turns it into content, implicitly allowing runtime to fetch it.

Risks:

- SSRF to internal services, data exfiltration, fetching overly large payloads, malicious content types, slowloris/timeouts.

Actions:

- Disable remote URL ingestion by default; require data URLs/base64 from trusted sources.
- If enabling URLs via config, use a centralized downloader (see plan) enforcing:
  - HTTPS only, no redirects, allowlist of hostnames, optional blocklist.
  - HEAD/GET with small timeouts, size cap (e.g., 5–10 MB), strict content-type whitelist (images only).
  - Streamed download with early abort on exceeding size, connection/read timeouts, limited redirects off.
  - Rate limiting and metrics; optional proxying through a controlled fetch service.

### 2) Provider call timeouts, retries, and circuit breakers

Locations:

- OpenAI/Anthropic/Google providers use SDK calls without explicit timeouts or retry strategies.
- Google provider uses `run_in_executor` for sync SDK without time limits.

Risks:

- Hung tasks, poor resilience to transient provider issues, noisy errors.

Actions:

- Wrap all provider calls in `asyncio.wait_for` with configurable timeouts.
- Add bounded retries with exponential backoff + jitter for retryable errors (rate limits, 5xx, timeouts).
- Add simple circuit breakers (per provider/model) to fail fast during outages.

### 3) Sensitive data in DB logs

Locations:

- `src/llmring/service.py` logs `system_prompt`, tool names, and raw error messages into DB via `record_api_call`.
- DB schema stores these fields (see prepared statements in `src/llmring/db.py`).

Risks:

- Secrets/PII compliance risk; log growth.

Actions:

- Redact or truncate sensitive fields by default; gate full detail behind a secure flag.
- Provide a redaction hook for application owners; define max lengths per field.
- Store tool names but avoid raw arguments unless explicitly enabled; consider hashing.

### 4) Operational reliability gaps

Areas:

- DB logging awaited on the hot path; a DB stall increases end-user latency.
- `print` used once for DB logging failure; inconsistent logging.
- SQLite concurrency can bottleneck; WAL not explicitly set.
- Temp files for OpenAI Responses+PDF are cleaned up, but crash could leave residue.

Actions:

- Move DB logging to a bounded background queue; drop when overloaded; use structured logging for failures.
- Replace `print` with `logger.warning`/`logger.exception` consistently.
- For SQLite: enable WAL, set recommended pragmas for concurrency; document dev-only nature.
- Consider `TemporaryDirectory` or startup cleanup sweep for leftover temp files.

### 5) Code quality and DX

- Multiple modules call `load_dotenv()` on import; move this to app entrypoints.
- Default provider inference picks first provider on unknown model; prefer explicit error unless configured mapping exists.
- Add type tightening for tool/response dicts; unify `usage` dict shape; consistent token counting notes.

## Centralized, controlled downloader design

Create a single module, e.g., `src/llmring/net/safe_fetcher.py`, and make all remote fetches go through it. Default to off; require explicit opt-in.

Capabilities and defaults:

- Disabled by default: `ALLOW_REMOTE_URLS=false`.
- HTTPS-only, `follow_redirects=false`.
- Host allowlist (exact hostnames or regex), optional blocklist; reject IP literals and private networks by default.
- HEAD preflight to check `Content-Length` and `Content-Type`; optional skip if server disallows; fallback guarded GET.
- Max size (e.g., 8 MB) and hard abort on overrun; max transfer time.
- Strict content-type whitelist (e.g., `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`, optionally `application/pdf`).
- Short connect/read timeouts (e.g., 2s connect, 5s read) and total deadline.
- Streamed download, no in-memory unbounded accumulation.
- Limited concurrency via per-host/per-domain semaphores.
- Retries with exponential backoff + jitter only for idempotent GET on transient errors.
- Observability: metrics and structured logs; correlation ID.

Public API (sketch):

```python
# src/llmring/net/safe_fetcher.py
class SafeFetcherConfig(TypedDict, total=False):
    allow_remote_urls: bool
    allowed_hosts: list[str]
    max_size_bytes: int
    connect_timeout_s: float
    read_timeout_s: float
    total_timeout_s: float
    content_types_allowed: list[str]
    follow_redirects: bool
    max_redirects: int

async def fetch_bytes(url: str, config: SafeFetcherConfig) -> tuple[bytes, str]:
    """Return (data, content_type). Raises SafeFetchError on violation or failure."""
```

Integration points:

- `OpenAIProvider`: replace inlining logic to either reject remote URLs or fetch via `SafeFetcher`, enforcing limits; optionally convert to data URL.
- `file_utils.create_file_content`: reject `http(s)` URLs unless config enables and use `SafeFetcher`; otherwise require data URLs/base64.
- Add a central configuration path with sensible defaults and env overrides.

Security posture:

- Default deny for remote URLs; strong controls if enabled; clearly documented warnings.

## Action plan (prioritized, with acceptance criteria)

### Phase 0 — Configuration scaffolding and flags

- Add global config for network safety and provider timeouts in a new config module or extend existing (`src/llmring/config.py`):
  - `ALLOW_REMOTE_URLS` (default false)
  - `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (comma-separated)
  - `MAX_DOWNLOAD_SIZE_BYTES` (default 8_388_608)
  - `CONNECT_TIMEOUT_S` (default 2.0), `READ_TIMEOUT_S` (default 5.0), `TOTAL_TIMEOUT_S` (default 10.0)
  - Provider call timeouts: `PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_S` (default 60.0)
  - Retry counts and backoff parameters
  - DB logging detail level: `DB_LOG_DETAIL=basic|redacted|full` (default `basic`)

Acceptance:

- Config values documented and loaded; sensible defaults; unit tests for parsing.

### Phase 1 — Centralized downloader and URL hardening

- Implement `src/llmring/net/safe_fetcher.py` with the capabilities above.
- Update `file_utils.create_file_content` to:
  - Reject `http(s)` by default with a clear error message.
  - If enabled, fetch via `SafeFetcher`; enforce content-type and size, then convert to data URL.
- Update `OpenAIProvider` inlining code to:
  - Remove ad-hoc `httpx.get`; use `SafeFetcher` or disable inlining entirely if remote URLs are not allowed.

Acceptance:

- Tests: reject HTTP/plain IPs/private subnets; allow only configured hosts; enforce size and content-type caps; timeouts honored; no redirects.
- No direct `httpx` or ad-hoc URL fetches remain outside `safe_fetcher`.

### Phase 2 — Provider call timeouts/retries/circuit breakers

- Wrap all provider SDK calls (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/Ollama) with `asyncio.wait_for(PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_S)`.
- Implement a small retry helper with backoff + jitter for retryable errors (rate limit/5xx/timeouts), max attempts (e.g., 2–3).
- Add a simple in-memory circuit breaker per provider/model with half-open probing.
- Google provider: wrap `run_in_executor` calls in `asyncio.wait_for`; propagate cancellation; add total deadlines.

Acceptance:

- Tests simulate transient failures and confirm retries/backoff/circuit breaking.
- Long-hanging calls are aborted at configured timeouts.

### Phase 3 — Sensitive data logging controls

- Add redaction/truncation in `service.py` before `record_api_call`:
  - Truncate `system_prompt`, `error_message`, and any tool-related strings to safe lengths (e.g., 2048 chars) or skip unless detail level is `full`.
  - Add a redaction function (regex-based) for secrets (API keys, AWS keys, bearer tokens, etc.).
- Consider storing only metadata by default and moving full prompts to a separate, optional table guarded by a feature flag.

Acceptance:

- Unit tests show redaction/truncation; environment flag toggles detail level; DB rows do not contain secrets by default.

### Phase 4 — DB logging off the hot path

- Wrap DB logging in a background worker with bounded queue (`asyncio.Queue(maxsize=N)`).
- Replace `print` with `logger.warning` and structured context.
- Ensure graceful shutdown drains queue within a small timeout.

Acceptance:

- Under induced DB latency, request latency remains stable; dropped logs are counted and warned once per interval.

### Phase 5 — SQLite and temp-file hygiene

- In `SQLiteDatabase.initialize()`, set `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;` and tuned pragmas for concurrency; document dev-only constraints.
- For OpenAI Responses+PDF path, consider `TemporaryDirectory` or track files for cleanup on startup; add a maintenance cleanup utility.

Acceptance:

- Tests validate WAL mode and foreign keys; temp files do not accumulate across runs in normal operation.

### Phase 6 — Code quality cleanups

- Move `load_dotenv()` calls to application entrypoints (`examples/fastapi_app.py`, CLI), not library imports.
- Change default provider inference to raise unless mapping configured.
- Replace remaining `print` calls; ensure consistent logging with request IDs.

Acceptance:

- No `load_dotenv()` in library modules; tests adjusted; docs updated.

### Phase 7 — Tests, docs, and observability

- Add tests for `SafeFetcher`, provider timeouts/retries, redaction, background logging, and Google executor timeouts.
- Document security settings, defaults, and guidance for enabling remote URLs safely.
- Add metrics hooks (counters for retries, breaker opens, dropped logs) and minimal health endpoints behavior in examples.

Acceptance:

- CI covers new tests; documentation section “Security & Safety” added; example app uses safe defaults.

## Code references (for convenience)

- OpenAI remote inlining (SSRF risk): `src/llmring/providers/openai_api.py` (around message content handling for `image_url`).
- URL acceptance: `src/llmring/file_utils.py` (`create_file_content` HTTP branch).
- Sensitive logging: `src/llmring/service.py` (system prompt, tools, errors before `record_api_call`); `src/llmring/db.py` prepared statements.
- Google sync executor: `src/llmring/providers/google_api.py` (use of `run_in_executor`).
- SQLite setup: `src/llmring/db_sqlite.py` (add WAL, pragmas).

---

## Notes on expected behavior after changes

- Remote URLs will be rejected unless explicitly enabled and comply with strict policies.
- Provider calls will respect configured deadlines and retry policies; repeated failures will trip circuit breakers temporarily.
- Database logs will exclude or truncate sensitive content by default.
- Overall latency and availability should improve under provider or DB stress.

---

## Future enhancements (optional)

- Streamed responses with backpressure; per-origin rate limits and budgets; OpenTelemetry tracing; structured error taxonomy; encrypted logging of highly sensitive fields where necessary.
